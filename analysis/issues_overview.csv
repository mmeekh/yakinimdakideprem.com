"Issue Name","Issue Type","Issue Priority","URLs","% of Total","Description","How To Fix","Help URL"
"Canonicals: Missing","Warning","Medium","17","73,910","Pages that have no canonical URL present either as a link element, or via HTTP header. If a page doesn't indicate a canonical URL, Google will identify what they think is the best version or URL. This can lead to ranking unpredictability when there are multiple versions discovered, and hence generally all URLs should specify a canonical version","Specify a canonical URL for every page to avoid any potential ranking unpredictability if multiple versions of the same page are discovered on different URLs.",""
"Links: Pages With High External Outlinks","Warning","Low","1","4,550","Pages that have a high number of followed external outlinks on them based upon the 'High External Outlinks' preferences under 'Config > Spider > Preferences'. External outlinks are hyperlinks to another subdomain or domain (depending on your configuration). This might be completely valid, such as linking to another part of the same root domain, or linking to other useful websites. External followed outlinks can be seen in the 'Outlinks' tab, with the 'All Link Types' filter set to 'Hyperlinks' where the 'Follow' column is 'True'.","Review followed external outlinks to ensure they are to credible, trusted and relevant websites that are useful to your users.",""
"Content: Low Content Pages","Opportunity","Medium","7","30,430","Pages with a word count that is below the default 200 words. The word count is based upon the content area settings used in the analysis which can be configured via 'Config > Content > Area'. There isn't a minimum word count for pages in reality, but the search engines do require descriptive text to understand the purpose of a page. This filter should only be used as a rough guide to help identify pages that might be improved by adding more descriptive content in the context of the website and page's purpose. Some websites, such as ecommerce, will naturally have lower word counts, which can be acceptable if a products details can be communicated efficiently.","Consider including additional descriptive content to help the user and search engines better understand the page.",""
"Page Titles: Outside <head>","Issue","High","16","72,730","Pages with a <title> element that is outside of the <head> element in the HTML. The page <title> should be within the <head> element, or search engines may ignore it. Google will often still recognise the page title even outside of the <head> element, however this should not be relied upon.","Ensure the page <title> element is in the <head> element of a page's HTML so that browsers can use it at the top of their window, and search engines can use it in scoring.",""
"Response Codes: Internal Client Error (4xx)","Issue","High","3","4,690","Internal URLs with a client-side error. This indicates a problem occurred with the URL request and can include responses such as 400 bad request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Page Not Found, 410 Removed, 429 Too Many Requests and more. A 404 'Page Not Found' is the most common, and often referred to as a broken link. View URLs that link to errors using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > Internal > Client Error (4xx) inlinks'.","All links on a website should ideally resolve to 200 'OK' URLs. Errors such as a 404 or 410 should be updated to their correct locations, removed and redirected where appropriate. A 403 forbidden error occurs when a web server denies access to the SEO Spider's request and can often be resolved by switching the user-agent to Chrome via 'Config > User-Agent' and crawling again.",""
"Meta Description: Outside <head>","Issue","Medium","16","72,730","Pages with a meta description that is outside of the <head> element in the HTML. The meta description should be within the <head> element, or search engines may ignore it.","Ensure meta descriptions are in the <head> element of a page's HTML so that search engines can choose to use them for their search engine result page snippets.",""
"Security: Missing Content-Security-Policy Header","Warning","Low","47","94,000","URLs that are missing the Content-Security-Policy response header. This header allows a website to control which resources are loaded for a page. This policy can help guard against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that exploit the browser's trust of the content received from the server. The SEO Spider only checks for existence of the header, and does not interrogate the policies found within the header to determine whether they are well set-up for the website. This should be performed manually.","Set a strict Content-Security-Policy response header across all page to help mitigate cross site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.",""
"Page Titles: Over 561 Pixels","Opportunity","Medium","13","59,090","Pages which have page titles over Google's estimated pixel length limit for titles in search results. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length. The SEO Spider tries to match the latest pixel truncation points in the SERPs, but it is an approximation and Google adjusts them frequently.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring.",""
"Response Codes: External No Response","Warning","Low","1","1,560","External URLs with no response returned from the server. Usually due to a malformed URL, connection timeout, connection error, or connection refused. View URLs that link to no responses using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > External > No Response inlinks'.","Malformed URLs should be updated to the correct location and other connection issues can often be resolved by using different user-agents ('Config > User-Agent'), adjusting the crawl speed ('Config > Speed') or disabling firewalls & proxies. If they can be viewed in a browser, then it's often not an issue.",""
"Content: Readability Difficult","Opportunity","Low","4","17,390","Copy on the page is difficult to read and best understood by college graduates according to the Flesch reading-ease score formula. Copy that has long sentences and uses complex words are generally harder to read and understand.","Consider improving the readability of copy for your target audience. Copy that uses shorter sentences with less complex words is often easier to read and understand.",""
"H2: Multiple","Warning","Low","21","95,450","Pages which have multiple <h2>s. This is not an issue as HTML standards allow multiple <h2>'s when used in a logical hierarchical heading structure. However, this filter can help you quickly scan to review if they are used appropriately.","Ensure <h2>s are used in a logical hierarchical heading structure, and update where appropriate utilising the full heading rank between (h3 - h6) for additional headings.",""
"Page Titles: Over 60 Characters","Opportunity","Medium","13","59,090","Pages which have page titles that exceed the configured limit. Characters over this limit might be truncated in Google's search results and carry less weight in scoring.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring.",""
"Meta Description: Over 985 Pixels","Opportunity","Low","8","36,360","Pages which have meta descriptions over Google's estimated pixel length limit for snippets. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length.

"H2: Duplicate","Opportunity","Low","3","13,640","Pages which have duplicate <h2>s. It's important to have distinct, unique and useful pages. If every page has the same <h2>, then it can make it more challenging for users and the search engines to understand one page from another.","Update duplicate <h2>s as necessary, so important pages contain a unique and descriptive <h2> for users and search engines.  If these are duplicate pages, then fix the duplicated pages by linking to a single version, and redirect or use canonicals where appropriate.",""
"Images: Over 100 KB","Opportunity","Medium","9","69,230","Large images over a size threshold. Page speed is extremely important for users and SEO and often large resources such as images are one of the most common issues that slow down web pages. This filter simply acts as a general rule of thumb to help identify images that are fairly large in file size and may take longer to load. These should be considered for optimisation, alongside opportunities identified in the PageSpeed tab which uses the PSI API and Lighthouse to audit speed. This can help identify images that haven't been optimised in size, load offscreen, are unoptimised etc.","Uncompressed images bloat pages with unnecessary bytes, so ensure images are optimised with compression, properly scaled, and using the best image format to reduce file size where possible.",""
"Meta Description: Over 155 Characters","Opportunity","Low","10","45,450","Pages which have meta descriptions over the configured limit. Characters over this limit might be truncated in Google's search results.","Write concise meta descriptions to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, and not visible to users.",""
"Canonicals: Outside <head>","Issue","High","16","69,570","Pages with a canonical link element that is outside of the <head> element in the HTML. The canonical link element should be within the <head> element, or search engines will ignore it.","Ensure canonical link elements are in the <head> element of a page's HTML to be considered by search engines.",""
"H1: Missing","Issue","Medium","1","4,550","Pages which have a missing <h1>, the content is empty or has a whitespace. The <h1> should describe the main title and purpose of the page and are considered to be one of the stronger on-page ranking signals.","Ensure important pages have concise, descriptive and unique headings to help users, and enable search engines to score and rank the page for relevant search queries.",""
"Content: Readability Very Difficult","Opportunity","Low","16","69,570","Copy on the page is very difficult to read and best understood by university graduates according to the Flesch reading-ease score formula.
